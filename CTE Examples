SQL CTE Query to find the average amount paid by the top 5 customers from top 10 countries.
The query uses CTEs to sequentially filter and aggregate data from the database.

--Step 1. CTE to identify the top 10 countries by the number of customers

WITH top_countries_cte AS (
    SELECT country.country
    FROM customer 
    INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
    INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id 
    INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
    GROUP BY country.country
    ORDER BY COUNT(customer.customer_id) DESC
    LIMIT 10
),

--Step 2. CTE to identify Top 5 customers based on total amount paid in top 10 countries

top_customers_cte AS (
    SELECT payment.customer_id, 
           customer.first_name, 
           customer.last_name, 
           city.city, 
           country.country, 
           SUM(payment.amount) AS total_amount_paid
    FROM payment
    INNER JOIN customer ON payment.customer_id = customer.customer_id
    INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id = address.address_id
    INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id = city.city_id 
    INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id = country.country_id
    WHERE country.country IN (SELECT country FROM top_countries_cte)
    GROUP BY payment.customer_id, customer.first_name, customer.last_name, city.city, country.country
    ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
-- Step 3. Query to calculate the average amount paid by the top 5 customers

SELECT AVG(total_amount_paid) AS avg_amount_paid
FROM top_customers_cte
LIMIT 5
